<p>The central canvas shows a growth medium in which an infectious organism
can grow. It represnts a two-dimensional space of cells mapped on to a
<i>toroidal</i> world - i.e. the left and right edges are adjacent, likewise
the top and bottom edges.&nbsp; Each cell (pixel) in the canvas can be
in one of three states:
<ul>
<li>
<b><i><font color="#000000">healthy</font></i></b> (<font color="#000000">green</font>)</li>

<li>
<b><i>infected</i></b> (red - how many is reported in the top left info
label)</li>

<li>
<b><i>immune</i></b> (blue - how many is reported in the top right info
label)</li>
</ul>
The medium evolves in cycles.&nbsp; In each cycle:
<ul>
<li>
if a healthy cell is nect to an infected one, there is a <i>rate%</i> chance
that it will become infected.&nbsp; The value of <i>rate</i> is controlled
by the slider on the left (and reported in the bottom left info label)..</li>

<li>
an infected cell may cease being infectious and become immune - it's still
sick but it won't infect anyone.&nbsp; The chance (%) of its remaining
infectious is governed by the top right slider (and reported in the bottom
middle info label).</li>

<li>
an immune cell may recover and become healthy again.&nbsp; The chance (%)
of an immune cell retaining its immunity is controlled by the bottom right
slider (and reported in the bottom right info label).&nbsp; There is a
<i>very small</i> chance that an immune cell may spontaenously become infectious
again - this is not under user control.</li>
</ul>
Initially, the model is active and all cells are healthy (green).&nbsp;
Other user controls are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
[LEFT MOUSE CLICK] introduces infection.</li>

<li>
[RIGHT MOUSE CLICK] immunises <i>healthy</i> cells (but does not change
<i>infected</i> ones).</li>

<li>
[MIDDLE MOUSE CLICK] makes <i>immune</i> cells <i>healthy </i>(but does
not change <i>infected</i> ones).</li>
</ul>
DRAGGING with the mouse button is PRESSED repeats the above CLICK operations
over the cells it passes.
<p>Pressing [SHIFT] at the same time as a mouse CLICK <i>sprays</i> the
action over a much wider area - the spray pattern is random and changes
each time.&nbsp; It is not necessary to keep the [SHIFT] key depressed
whilst DRAGGING.
<p>Pressing [CTRL] at the same time as a mouse CLICK locks (logically)
the mouse button down.&nbsp; The mouse button can now be released and the
system will respond to mouse movements as though it was being DRAGGED (i.e.
as though the button was held down).&nbsp; The next mouse click (on <i>any</i>
button) release this lock.&nbsp; [<b><i>Note:</i></b> this only applies
to the LEFT and RIGHT buttons.&nbsp; JDK 1.1/1.2/1.3 all report the [CTRL]
key pressed on the MIDDLE button regardless as to whether it really is
pressed.]
<p>Presing [SHIFT] <i>and</i> [CTRL] at the same time as a mouse CLICK
combines the above effects.
<p>Finally, there are [FREEZE/IUNFREEZE] and [RESET] buttons.&nbsp; The
[RESET], which clears the medium back to all <i>healthy</i> cells, is only
enabled if the system is <i>frozen</i>.
<p><b><i>Challenge:</i></b> with the initial settings of the slider rates,
start an infection in the middle and try to eradicate it by spraying.&nbsp;
Now try it with an infection from a corner region.&nbsp; Reduce the inititial
<i>immune persistence rate</i> from 99% to 98%.&nbsp; Can you still eradicate
it?
<p><b><i>Experiment:</i></b> with different settings of the sliders.&nbsp;
The original version of this model had the two right-side sliders at zero.
<p>Enjoy!
