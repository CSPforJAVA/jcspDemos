<p>[LEFT-MOUSE-CLICK] on the drawing canvas to get a target box that moves with
the mouse pointer.  The size of this box can be altered by the [UP-ARROW] and
[DOWN-ARROW] keys.  Its colour can be changed (just black or white) by the
<i>Target</i> choice box.  The box can be erased by a [RIGHT-MOUSE-CLICK].

<p>Having obtained a target box, move and resize it so that it is over an area
of interest.  [LEFT-MOUSE-CLICK] again (or press the [CARRIAGE-RETURN] key) to
enlarge the area within the box to the full size of the applet canvas.

<p>Whilst the new image is being computed, a <i>progress bar</i> scrolls down
the canvas to give an indication of how fast things are going.  The relative position
of the bar in the canvas corresponds to the relative area of computation currently being
performed within the box.  This progress bar can be eliminated by selecting
the <i>None</i> option in the <i>Scrolling</i> choice box.  Other options are
<i>Up</i> and <i>Down</i>, which cause the new image to be displayed as it is
being computed - however, this usually slows everything down as the image rendering
(usually) dominates the computation cost.  The <i>Silent</i> option is the default,
which yields the progress bar.

<p>The <i>Iterations</i> choice box lets us set the maximum number of iterations
for the Mandelbrot calculation.  There are very interesting regions where this
needs to be set to 32K - find them!

<p>The images can be rendered with two colour maps - <i>Step</i> and <i>Fade</i>
selectable from the <i>Colours</i> choice box.  Some areas look better with
one and some with the other.

<p>Previous images are remembered and may be recovered by clicking the <i>Backward</i>
button.  Having gone back, we can go <i>Forward</i> again.  Two clicks are needed
for this: the first shows a target box over the area we have just come from (or are
about to go to) and the second allows us to <i>Confirm</i> or <i>Cancel</i> the move.

<p>The coordinates of the <i>top-left</i> point in the image are displayed in the
<i>Top</i> and <i>Left</i> labels (above the canvas).  The resolution between points
is shown in the <i>Scale</i> label.

<p>The Mandelbrot computation is performed by a classical <i>worker process farm</i>.
Areas of the image are farmed out to idle workers a few lines at a time.  On a (SMP)
multiprocessor, real speedup will be obtained as all processors will be used
(assuming our JVM runs with native threads).  A running computation can be cancelled
by clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button (that is only enabled during such a run).

<p><i>Minor detail:</i> the default size of the target box can be increased only to
around 70% of the size of the applet canvas (and has the same aspect ratio).
To target an image of the same resolution, but shifted slightly horizontally or
vertically, a target box the same size as the canvas is required.  This is allowed
by using [SHIFT-LEFT-MOUSE-CLICK] to create the box (instead of LEFT-MOUSE-CLICK]).
