These directories hold the examples used in the javadoc for
the main JCSP library.  The structure of these directories
mirrors those in the library.  Most have Main programs from
which they can be compiled and run:

  * change into any of the directories with .java files;
  * javac *java;
  * java (i.e. run) the ones with main methods (these usually
    have "Main" as part of their name).
