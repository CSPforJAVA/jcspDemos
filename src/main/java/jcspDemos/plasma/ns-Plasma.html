<p>The <i>Colours</i> choice box offers four colour tables.
The <i>Scale</i> choice box offers five scales of computation.
In <i>1:8</i> scale, only one point in each 8 x 8 box in the plasma
is computed and that colour is rendered for the whole of that box.
The <i>Freeze</i> button freezes the animation.

<p>The <i>Genetic Code</i> sequence shows 8 integer parameters
whose values effect various properties of the plasma being animated.
Each position in the sequence controls a different property.
These vales may be altered by editing the text entry window.
However, each edit must atomically leave 8 integers.  The line
is parsed after each edit and, if illegal (e.g. 9 integers or
some non-integer character), it is set back to its previous sequence.
Negative integers are allowed.

<p>Interesting sequences (which you can cut and paste into the above
<i>Genetic Code</i> box) are:

<PRE>
  2   5   1  4     16   23   13   10       <I>(try scale 1:2 and colour Green/Blue)</I>
  32  5  31 44     16   23   13   10
  32  5  31 44    206  203   13   10
  32  5  31 44    206  203  103   10
  32  5  31 44    206  203  103  100
</PRE>

<p>The <i>Frames/Second</i> label at the top shows the number of
plasma frames <i>computed</i> per second.  For the higher scale
values, this will be more than the number of frames actually being
<i>rendered</i> per second - the rendering keeps up as best it can.
