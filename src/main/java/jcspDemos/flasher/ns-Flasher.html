<P>This just demonstrates sensitivity to mouse entry/exit events on the
applet at the same time as performing a background computation.&nbsp; Move
the mouse pointer into the applet panel and it will start flashing.&nbsp;
Move it out and the panel goes black.
<P>The period of the flashing is set by the <I>period </I>applet parameter.&nbsp;
The flashing colours are mostly pastel - not too violent.
