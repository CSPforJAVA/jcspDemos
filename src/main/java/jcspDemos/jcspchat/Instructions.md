**jcspchat - A networked chat system**

Both versions of this system are best run over a real network with different users running their 
client on a different machine.

**net**
run ChatPlusServerMainNet
The process will start by creating a CNS, if one is not already running.
The Chat channel name can be left at the default, press Create.  A window will appear
indicating the location of the global server node.  The IP address will be required by
all the clients.  Only press Exit when you want to terminate the chat system and 
all the clients have previously closed their windows.

The console output indicates the interactions that are taking place.

run ChatPlusClientMainNet
This can be done on the same machine but preferably on another machine.
A splash screen will appear. Type in the Server address which is the IP address of the Global Node.
Unless you have changed the name of the Chat Channel Name leave it at the default, otherwise 
change to the name previously used.  Insert a name by which this instance of the chat client 
is to be known, press Connect.
A multi-panel window will open.  The bottom area is where messages are typed. 
The top right hand top panel gives the text that has been sent between chatters.  You may have 
to move the panel separator down to show the top left hand panel which is the area in which 
you can draw images.
For a first demo make sure all the chatters have connected and have sent an intial message 
to each other.  Then they can start to draw in the drawing panel and these should appear on each
others drawing panels.
A client finishes simply by closing their window in the usual manner.

It would appear that if a client starts after something has been drawn then they cannot 
see what has already been drawn.  That is left as a challenge for the reader!!
